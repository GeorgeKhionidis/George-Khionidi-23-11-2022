Specs
1. Create a header with the drawer menu with navigation for the Main and Favorites screen.
2. The Main screen (weather details) will be composed of a search field to search a location’s weather by city name. And below it, the current weather and a 5-day forecast of the searched location. A location should have an indication if it’s already saved in favorites, and a button to add/remove from favorites (it can be the same button).
3. Display Tel Aviv weather by default.
4. The favorites screen will be composed of a list of favorite locations. Each location
should have an ID, name, and current weather. Clicking on a favorite will navigate to the
Main screen showing the details of that location.
5. Searching should be done in English letters only.
6. State management is a must! Please, use RTK.
7. Error handling is a must! (can be done with toast, modal).
